First full program I wrote actually utilizing OOP. 
Take input file and parse information about students, classes, and grades. 
"Create" a report for a student.
First implementation of templated linked list(s). 

This was a base that later implemented teachers schedules, teachers class rosters and everything needed for a school to have a registration and grading system. Besides the required databases and CRUD systems.
